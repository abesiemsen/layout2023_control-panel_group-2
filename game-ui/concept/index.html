    <h1>Game Concept</h1>
    <p>My game is a mobile version of board game called Rummikub. There will be at least two and at most four players in the game. The players have to share the big board to put their cards to win the game according to the rule. Each of them will be able to see their own board of cards with numbers. </p>

    <h1>UI Components</h1>
    <p>The UI components for this game will include the buttons that the users can use to organize their cards in certain orders. It will also include user profile with their own user ID and the level for each user. The users will also be able to see their own money balance to see how many games they are allowed to play. Most importantly, there will be a button that the users will use to receive a single card when they have to or want to. </p>
